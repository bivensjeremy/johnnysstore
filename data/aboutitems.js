It is mostly a portfolio project to display my ability than a shop I want to promote. But, as long as I am working at it, I might as well build something real! Read through the FAQs if you have general questions about how this site works.'

For those who have viewed by portfolio and GitHub, you will notice I initially created this same shop using vanilla React. Since then, I have learned a lot more and wanted to update the site with a more modern feel and added functionality. It is built using Next JS, Material UI, Commerce JS and Stripe along with a host of dependencies.'

As such, I had access to all the latest fashion at a discount. As you may remember, the 2000s was a crazy time for urban wear.  We liked our clothes with extra breathing room! Most of these items are extremely lightly worn. Because they have always been in such good condition, I have been reluctant to throw them away.  I have always intended to sell them at the flea market, but I have no desire to wheel & deal, haggle and negotiate.'
