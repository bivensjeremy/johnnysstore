## Project Description

This project is built using Next.js, Material UI, and Commerce.js. It is a fully functional store to add to the Bivens Blueprint portfolio. It is a remake of "Digital Dealz", also made for the portfolio. 
=======
It is a rebuild of a store in my repo called "Digital Dealz", built exclusively using React, Commerce JS, and Stripe. 

Since I've learned more, I wanted to redesign, and implement some of this knowledge. It utilizes a modern design, scalable for tablet and mobile.

Important to note: it is a full working system, not set up for testing. If a purchase is made, a receipt will be sent, and the item will be shipped from inventory. While a passion project, it is a real store.

I may make updates along the way to improve functionality.
